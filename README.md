## API

Created a simple [API](https://imdb-best-winners.herokuapp.com/) that scraps data from IMDB pages. It is hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Currently it returns the top 5 movies that won an oscar.

## Dependency Injection

Here I leveraged the power of: [Getit](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) to do the magic

## Data

I used [Flutter XML](https://pub.dev/packages/xml) to parse XML files

## Date

[intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) enabled me to manage dates easily
